# Self-reading — CodeSemantics

A reading of this repository's own Java sources by the library that reads repositories, over a
parse of the working tree. What it reads is what this repository **declared** — its types,
methods, fields, parameters and locals — the **prose** it wrote in javadoc and comments, and the
**dependencies** it named that are neither the platform's nor its own.

Everything else a Java file contains is somebody else's vocabulary quoted: `String`, `List` and
`assertThat` are uses of declarations the platform and the test framework made, and a use is not
a word this codebase chose. Only a parse can tell the two apart, which is why this reading needs
one. λ is the share of those word occurrences at least one bundled resource can be cited for.

The repository's own words are 71,037 occurrences of 3,437 distinct surfaces, 1,084 of them (31.5%) written exactly once. 269 glued runs no boundary divided were read by the segmenter; 1,572 occurrences across 231 surfaces nothing could be cited for at all.
